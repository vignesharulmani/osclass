==========

Are you having mailing issues in your Osclass site? Undelivered e-mails, delayed or lost? 

This plugin allows you to send your emails from Amazon servers. You only need to create an Amazon SES account and configure Osclass with the keys given by Amazon.
Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) is a highly scalable and cost-effective email-sending service for businesses and developers. Amazon SES eliminates the complexity and expense of building an in-house email solution or licensing, installing, and operating a third-party email service for this type of email communication.
